# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

This is a simple number guessing game built with JavaScript. The program generates a random number between a specified range, and the player has to guess the correct number. 

## How It Works

- A random number is generated between a minimum (`minNum`) and maximum (`maxNum`) value (default: 1 - 100).
- The player is prompted to guess the number.
- After each guess, the player receives feedback:
- "TOO LOW! TRY AGAIN!" if the guess is lower than the generated number.
- "TOO HIGH! TRY AGAIN!" if the guess is higher than the generated number.
- "CORRECT!" if the guess is right, along with the number of attempts made.
- The game ends once the correct number is guessed.

## How to Play

1. **Clone the repository** or copy the code into your own project.
2. **Open the HTML file** in your browser or run the code in a JavaScript environment.
3. The game will **prompt you to guess** a number between the given range.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!
5. You will be notified if your guess is too low, too high, or correct.

## Features

- **Random number generation** between any two values.
- **Input validation** to ensure the player guesses a valid number.
- Feedback on whether the guess is too **high** or **low**.
- Track the **number of attempts** made to guess the correct number.

## Technologies
